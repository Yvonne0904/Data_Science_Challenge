# Employee Rentention

## Challenge Description:

We have data about all employees who joined from 2011/01/24 to 2015/12/13. For each employee, we also know if they are still at the company as of 2015/12/13 or they have quit. Beside that, we have general info about the employee, such as avg salary during her tenure, dept, and yrs of experience.

## Goal:

As said above, the goal is to predict employee retention and understand its main drivers. Specifically, you should:

### Task(a)

You should create a table with 3 columns: day, employee_headcount, company_id.

### Task(b)

What are the main factors that drive employee churn? Do they make sense? Explain your findings.

### Task(c)

If you could add to this data set just one variable that could help explain employee churn, what would that be?

## Data:

- Employee_id
- Company_id
- dept
- seniority: number of yrs of work experience when hired
- salary
- Join_date
- Quit_date
